smart branching:
    Two arrays are used are ROM. One contains the brainfuck code, 
    the second contain, at the same adress as a bracket, 
    the adrres of the matching bracket.
    Durring loading, each time a [ is encountered, its adress is stored on
    a stack. When a ] is encountered, the adress at the top of the stack
    is popped and the second ROM array is filled with correct values.
